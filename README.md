# 636_FinalProject

# NZ Winter Olympics Project Report
## Assumptions
- The listmembers function from the public interface, the list showing has changed its order. Instead of showing memberID and TeamID, "Name" is created to combine FirstName and LastName from the db so the clickable link doesnt have a confusion. Also because of the link, the names have been moved to the first colunm.  
- Add/Edit function has a assumption that the memberid is readyonly and not chaangeable when editting. Also, a drop down has created to choose a team as I assume there is only new team added at the same time as adding a member.
